# Intro-to-Programming-FBLA-Event
2023-2024 SLC FBLA Intro to Programming - Ria Bhatia, Kevin Dutta, Hiroto Honda

Hello! To run our code, you can click the Intro to Programming FBLA py file above open the executable file, to run the standalone code. You then run the code and follow the engaging steps throughout the program. Our code will be able to provide unweighted GPA and weighted GPA through interactive steps. User will be asked the amount of classes they are taking, whether they want to calculate unweighted, weighted, or both, and will be asked to input letter grades as well as class weights. The amount of classes you enter will be the amount of grades you input for each class as it will repeat until it satisifes the number of classes. Enjoy your personal GPA Calculator!
